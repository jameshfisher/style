    \item {\bf An impeccable grasp of English spelling and grammar.}
               I write for pleasure,
               and enjoy communicating ideas with a flair, clarity and conciseness. 

    \item {\bf An eye for aesthetics, design, and presentation.}
               I adore understated typography
               and prioritize functional communication in my designs.

    \item {\bf Problem-solving and strategic thinking.}
               I will thrive in an intellectually challenging workplace
               (but working as a cog in the machine interests me, too).

\subject{Personal}

\startcolumns[n=2]
  I must admit that my hobbies are mainly solitary.
    Drawing and painting use considerable time,
      from mindless scribbling to executing commissions.
    I read often,
      favouring difficult books and just occasionally finishing them.
    I am an ameteur critic of inconsequential things,
      a dyed-in-the-wool systematizer,
      and where I see failings I cannot resist tinkering.
    I fall in love with infographics and typefaces.

  I enjoy socialising too!:
    I visit the gym regularly,
    and, when I get the time, like walking and exploring.
    I've travelled Europe via inter-rail with a group of friends,
    and have eventual plans to teach English as a foreign language.
